# The-journey-in-competitive-programming
This repository documents my personal journey in Competitive Programming. I’ll be uploading daily/weekly practice codes, algorithms, problem solutions, and learning notes. The goal is to track progress, improve problem-solving skills, and master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) through consistent practice.
