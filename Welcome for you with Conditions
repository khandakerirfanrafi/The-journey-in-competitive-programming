//In this program, two integers A and B are taken as input from the user. The program then compares the two numbers using an if-else condition. If A is greater than or equal to B, it prints “Yes”. Otherwise, if A is smaller than B, it prints “No”. In short, the program checks whether the first number is greater than or equal to the second number and displays the result accordingly.
